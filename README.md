“Amna is a very polite and punctual person. She asked questions to ascertain what was required and came up with a good idea or two along the way. She completed the revisions I needed without complaint and I cannot speak highly enough of her attitude and capabilities. I would highly recommend Amna to anyone looking for services she can offer and I will gladly use her services again should I need anything. Thank you Amna!”
